# Adaptive Testing with IRT

Design computerized adaptive tests that measure ability efficiently and accurately using Item Response Theory.

## Core Concept

Adaptive tests adjust difficulty in real-time based on student responses. A correct answer → harder question. Incorrect → easier question. The result: accurate ability estimates in ~50% fewer questions than fixed-length tests.

**Key advantage:** Traditional tests waste time on too-easy or too-hard questions. Adaptive tests spend time where measurement matters most — near the student's ability level.

## IRT Fundamentals

### The 3-Parameter Logistic (3PL) Model

Most adaptive tests use the 3PL model. Each question has three parameters:

- **a** (discrimination) — How well the question differentiates ability levels. Higher = steeper curve. Typical range: 0.5 to 2.5
- **b** (difficulty) — The ability level where P(correct) = 0.5. Range: -3 to +3 (standardized scale)
- **c** (guessing) — Probability of guessing correctly. Usually 0.2 to 0.25 for multiple choice

**Probability of correct response:**

```
P(correct | ability, a, b, c) = c + (1 - c) / (1 + e^(-a(ability - b)))
```

**Simpler models:**

- **2PL:** Set c = 0 (no guessing parameter)
- **1PL (Rasch):** Set c = 0 and a = 1 for all items (only difficulty varies)

Use 3PL for high-stakes tests. Use 2PL/1PL when sample size is small (<500 responses per item).

### Information and Standard Error

**Information** measures how precisely an item estimates ability at a given level. Peak information occurs when ability ≈ difficulty (b parameter).

**Standard Error (SE)** is the inverse of information:

```
SE = 1 / sqrt(Information)
```

**Goal of CAT:** Maximize information (minimize SE) at the student's true ability level.

## Test Design Workflow

### 1. Define Test Specifications

- **Purpose:** Placement, diagnostic, certification, progress monitoring?
- **Content domain:** Single skill or multidimensional?
- **Target population:** What ability range (-3 to +3)?
- **Constraints:** Time limit, minimum/maximum length, content balance

### 2. Build Item Bank

**Minimum bank size:** 10× the average test length. For a 20-item CAT, you need ≥200 calibrated items.

**Distribution targets:**

- Difficulty (b): Spread across expected ability range
- Discrimination (a): Target 1.0 to 2.0 (high discrimination)
- Exposure: No item used >20% of the time

**Content balancing:** If testing math, ensure geometry/algebra/etc. are proportionally represented.

### 3. Choose Algorithms

Pick one from each category:

**Item selection:** (see below)

- Maximum Information
- Randomesque (MFI + exposure control)
- Content balancing

**Ability estimation:**

- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Expected A Posteriori (EAP) — better for extreme scores
- Weighted Likelihood (WLE)

**Stopping rule:** (see below)

- Fixed length
- Standard error threshold
- Information threshold

### 4. Simulate Performance

Before going live, simulate 1000+ test sessions with known abilities. Check:

- Average test length
- SE at different ability levels
- Item exposure rates
- Content balance adherence

Adjust if needed.

## Item Selection Strategies

### Maximum Fisher Information (MFI)

**Rule:** Select the item with highest information at current ability estimate.

**Pros:** Optimal precision, shortest tests
**Cons:** Overuses "best" items, poor security

**Use when:** Pilot testing, low-stakes practice

### Randomesque (MFI + Exposure Control)

**Rule:** Select from top N items by information (e.g., top 5), choose randomly from that set.

**Pros:** Balances precision and security
**Cons:** Slightly longer tests than pure MFI

**Use when:** Operational tests, default choice

### a-Stratified

**Rule:** Start with high-discrimination items (high a), use mid-discrimination later.

**Pros:** Fast initial ability estimate
**Cons:** Complex to implement

**Use when:** Very large item banks, research settings

### Content Balancing

**Rule:** Track content area usage, prioritize underrepresented areas when selecting next item.

**Implementation:** Weight information by content constraint satisfaction.

**Use when:** Blueprint requirements, multidimensional tests

---

## Stopping Rules

### Fixed Length

Stop after N items (e.g., 20 questions).

**Pros:** Predictable time, simple
**Cons:** May over/under-test some students

**Use when:** Time limits matter, simple implementation needed

### Standard Error Threshold

Stop when SE < target (e.g., SE < 0.3).

**Pros:** Consistent precision across ability levels
**Cons:** Variable test length (harder to schedule)

**Typical targets:**

- Low-stakes: SE < 0.4
- Medium-stakes: SE < 0.3
- High-stakes: SE < 0.25

**Use when:** Precision matters more than time

### Combined Rule

Stop when (SE < target) OR (length ≥ max) OR (length ≥ min AND ability estimate stable).

**Use when:** Production systems (safest approach)

## Practical Considerations

### Starting Ability Estimate

**Options:**

1. Population mean (θ = 0)
2. Prior information (e.g., grade level, previous test)
3. First question is medium difficulty, estimate from there

Never start at extremes (-3 or +3).

### Handling Extreme Response Patterns

**All correct or all incorrect:** MLE fails. Use EAP or Bayesian prior to regularize.

**Rapid changes:** If ability estimate jumps >1.0, consider response anomaly (cheating, guessing).

### Exposure Control

Track how often each item is used. Flag items used >20% of the time. Consider:

- Randomesque selection (above)
- Sympson-Hetter method (advanced)
- Periodic item bank refresh

### Multidimensional IRT (MIRT)

If testing multiple skills (e.g., algebra + geometry), use separate ability estimates per dimension. Select items to balance information across dimensions.

**Warning:** MIRT requires larger item banks and more complex calibration.

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Too few items in bank** → High exposure, security risk
✅ Aim for 10× average test length

❌ **Poorly distributed difficulties** → Accurate only in narrow ability range  
✅ Spread items across -2 to +2 difficulty

❌ **Ignoring content balance** → May skip important topics  
✅ Build content constraints into item selection

❌ **Using MLE for all incorrect** → Returns -∞  
✅ Use EAP or cap estimates at -3/+3

❌ **No exposure control** → Same items every test  
✅ Use randomesque or Sympson-Hetter

## When to Load References

| Need                                                    | File                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Calibrate new items (collect data, estimate parameters) | `references/calibration.md`    |
| Implement CAT algorithm (code patterns, libraries)      | `references/implementation.md` |

## Real-World Example: K-12 Math Placement

**Setup:**

- Item bank: 300 questions, b from -2 (basic) to +2 (advanced)
- Target: SE < 0.35 or max 25 questions
- Content: 40% algebra, 30% geometry, 30% statistics
- Algorithm: Randomesque (top 5), EAP estimation

**Flow:**

1. Start at θ = 0 (grade-level average)
2. Select item: b ≈ 0, content area needed
3. Student answers → update ability estimate (EAP)
4. Select next: maximize information at new θ, respect content balance, randomesque from top 5
5. Stop when SE < 0.35 or 25 questions reached
6. Report: ability estimate + placement recommendation

**Result:** Average 18 questions, 95% of students placed within ±0.5 grade levels of true ability.
