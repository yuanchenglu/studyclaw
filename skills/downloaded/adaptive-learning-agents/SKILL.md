# Adaptive Learning Agent

**Learn from errors and corrections in real-time. Continuously improve by capturing failures, user feedback, and successful patterns.**

Free and open-source (MIT License) • Zero dependencies • Works locally

---

## 🚀 Why This Skill?

### Problem Statement

Working with Claude or any AI agent means encountering:

- Mistakes that need correction
- Unexpected API behaviors
- Better approaches discovered through experimentation
- Knowledge gaps that get revealed during use

But there's no systematic way to **learn from these moments** and apply the knowledge next time.

### The Solution

**Adaptive Learning Agent** captures every error, correction, and successful pattern automatically. Then retrieves relevant learnings before tackling similar problems again.

### Real Use Cases

- **Bug discovery**: Record an error once, never struggle with it again
- **Prompt optimization**: Keep track of what prompt variations work best
- **API integration**: Remember quirky behaviors and workarounds
- **Workflow improvement**: Document shortcuts and best practices
- **Team knowledge**: Export and share learnings across projects

---

## ✨ What You Get

### Four Core Functions

**1. Record Learnings**

```python
agent.record_learning(
    content="Use claude-sonnet for 90% of tasks—faster and cheaper",
    category="technique",
    context="Model selection"
)
```

Capture successful patterns, insights, and best practices.

**2. Record Errors**

```python
agent.record_error(
    error_description="JSON parsing failed on null values",
    context="Processing API response",
    solution="Add null check before parsing"
)
```

Document failures and solutions automatically.

**3. Search & Retrieve Learnings**

```python
results = agent.search_learnings("JSON parsing")
recent = agent.get_recent_learnings(limit=5)
by_category = agent.get_learnings_by_category("bug-fix")
```

Find relevant knowledge instantly when you need it.

**4. View Summaries**

```python
summary = agent.get_learning_summary()
print(agent.format_learning_summary())
```

Understand what you've learned at a glance.

### Key Features

✅ **Zero dependencies** - Pure Python, works everywhere
✅ **Local-only storage** - All data on your machine, no uploads
✅ **MIT Licensed** - Free to use, modify, fork, redistribute
✅ **Automatic categorization** - Errors become learnings
✅ **Search and filter** - Find knowledge by keyword or category
✅ **Export capability** - Share learnings as JSON
✅ **No API keys** - Works without any external credentials

## 📊 Real-World Example

```python
from adaptive_learning_agent import AdaptiveLearningAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = AdaptiveLearningAgent()

# Day 1: Discover a bug
agent.record_error(
    error_description="Anthropic API rejects prompts with excessive newlines",
    context="Testing prompt with formatted lists",
    solution="Use \\n.strip() to clean whitespace before sending"
)

# Day 2: Same bug, but now you have the solution
similar_errors = agent.search_learnings("newlines")
# Result: [Previous learning with solution] ✅

# Week 1: Document successful pattern
agent.record_learning(
    content="Always use temperature=0 for deterministic output in tests",
    category="best-practice",
    context="Prompt engineering"
)

# Get weekly summary
summary = agent.get_learning_summary()
print(f"You've recorded {summary['total_learnings']} learnings this week!")
print(f"Resolved {summary['error_statistics']['resolved']} errors")
```

---

## 🔧 Installation

No installation needed! The skill is pure Python with zero dependencies.

```bash
# Copy the adaptive_learning_agent.py file to your project
# Or import it directly:

from adaptive_learning_agent import AdaptiveLearningAgent
```

---

## 💡 Use Cases

### Software Development

Record bugs you find and their fixes. Next time you hit a similar error, you have the solution ready.

```python
agent.record_error(
    error_description="Port 8000 already in use",
    context="Running local dev server",
    solution="Use `lsof -i :8000` to find process, then kill it"
)
```

### Prompt Engineering

Keep track of prompting techniques that work for your specific use cases.

```python
agent.record_learning(
    content="Chain-of-thought works better for math problems, direct answers for facts",
    category="technique"
)
```

### API Integration

Remember quirky behaviors and workarounds for each provider.

```python
agent.record_learning(
    content="OpenAI API requires explicit 'assistant' role messages",
    category="api-endpoint",
    context="Chat completion endpoint"
)
```

### Team Knowledge

Export learnings and share with your team or future projects.

```python
agent.export_learnings("team_learnings.json")
# Share this file with teammates
```

### Continuous Improvement

Before major tasks, review what you've learned to avoid repeating mistakes.

```python
summary = agent.get_learning_summary()
unresolved = summary['error_statistics']['unresolved']
if unresolved > 0:
    print(f"⚠️ {unresolved} unresolved errors—review before proceeding")
```

## 📚 Categories

When recording learnings, choose from these categories:

| Category           | Use For                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **technique**      | Working methods, approaches, strategies |
| **bug-fix**        | Solutions to errors and problems        |
| **api-endpoint**   | API-specific behaviors and quirks       |
| **constraint**     | Limits, boundaries, restrictions        |

## 🎯 Sources

When recording learnings, specify the source:

- `user-correction` - User told you something was wrong
- `error-discovery` - You found the solution to an error
- `successful-pattern` - You discovered something that works well
- `user-feedback` - User suggested an improvement
